excerpt: >
  We introduce a DMRG study of the 1D Hubbard–SSH model with full phonon dispersion,  
  uncovering how dopant density and coupling strengths drive polaron formation,  
  CDW tendencies, and spin-gap opening.

## Abstract

This paper presents a detailed density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) analysis of the  
one-dimensional Hubbard–Su–Schrieffer–Heeger model with dispersive optical phonons. We  
map out how doping and varying electron-phonon coupling lead to polaron and bipolaron  
formation, charge-density-wave correlations, and the emergence of a spin gap, drawing  
direct connections to experimental RIXS and ARPES observations.

## Highlights

- **Full phonon dispersion:** Goes beyond Einstein phonons to include realistic $ω(q)$.  
- **Doping dependence:** Tracks polaron size and dynamics as a function of hole concentration.  
- **Spin gap & CDW:** Identifies parameter regimes with a pure Luther–Emery phase.  
- **Experimentally relevant:** Spectral functions computed for direct RIXS/ARPES comparisons.
